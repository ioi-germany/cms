# Some specialized types (like CIDR) have a natural textual
# representation and PostgreSQL automatically converts them to and from
# it. However that conversion isn't automatic when these types are
# wrapped inside an ARRAY (e.g., TEXT[] can't be automatically cast to
# CIDR[]). This subclass of ARRAY performs such casting explicitly for
# each entry.
