\def\tPartialfeedback{Partial feedback is given for this task, i.e.~you can see the verdicts for a fixed subset of the testcases. The score shown refers to this selection of testcases and therefore \emph{hints} towards your real score, which can be either lower or higher.}

\def\tTokenFeedback{\emph{Tokens} are available for this task, i.e.~you can obtain feedback for a limited number of submissions by applying a so called token. More information, e.g.~about the number of available tokens, can be found in the contest system.}
\def\tTokenRestrictedFeedback{However, even when you've applied a token, for each testcase group you are only shown the verdict for the first testcase with minimal score in that group. (The order of the testcases in each of the groups is fixed.)}
